## Overview

The purpose of this project is to present a greeting card with 13 elements, music, 3 different types of polygons and more. 

## Compiling and Using

On the browser do ctrl- o and open the folder to access the card. In there, open index.html and the card should show up on ur browser screen. And on the screen we can play the music giving you control over the music play.  

## Discussion

I had a lot of code errors that i would debug in the end. Initally when i started coding, the snow fall gif was broken so it wouldnt work and i had to ask a bunch of people to help but eventually we realsied that it was broken. In the beginning i made a different poster but then i didnt like it so i changed the enitre code and restarted which helped me imporvise. I did some research like how we can add background color in one line, and how to remove background off images and gifs. I think if i had more time and wanted to impovise it i could make a tranisition and add more complexity. Yes I learnt a lot like javascript syntax, the formating and more keywords.  


## Testing

I would write the code, open it on my browser and run it so that, the position, other style features and elements would show up how i want it to. The purpose is to create a greeting card with a bunch of elements, music, and different polygons. So i made sure to add all of the elements and all the requirements. + the asthetics 


## Extra Credit

I added a lot of extra elements and lot of other features ig :)

I used a lab guide for the greeting card project . 

I used stackflow for the background color.
